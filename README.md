## Chai Design System
---

What is a design system:

To learn more about this look at this [Why Design Systems](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/whyDesignSystems.md) -  Explains the need for a design system in the context of compose.

## About Chai

Chai is swahili word for tea.
This is the droidconKE design system.

Link to the [design doc](https://xd.adobe.com/view/eb1ed4ed-fd4d-4ba2-b2f7-a91c7379a022-be4d/screen/cfea72b5-9007-4335-ae86-9162594c094f/)


This Project shows how you can use this design system in a multi module app monoRepo set up.


### Structure Of Chai's Design System,

The Chai Design System Architecture is captured in detail:
1. [Why Design Systems](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/whyDesignSystems.md) -  Explains the need for a design system in the context of compose.
2. [Architecture](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/architecture.md) -  The architecture of the project
3. [Chai Design System Architecture](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/chaiArchitecture.md) -  The architecture of the design system
4. [buildlogic](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/buildlogic.md) -  Handles how we build the app wiyth gradle, ditches the build src in favour of convengion polugins.
5. [chaiLinter](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/chaiLinter.md) -  Explains the design system linter
6. [Atoms](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/atoms.md) - Explains the atoms in the design system
7. [Components](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/components.md) -  Design system components
7. [chaidemop](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/components.md) -  Design system components
7. [chaitime](https://github.com/droidconKE/chai/blob/master/docs/.md) -  Design system components

## Implementing Chai

To Implement chai,

See the example implementation that  exists by running chaidemo that contains the various implementations of the elements of the design system.
The specific components have documentation fused in as in any other code project
